Once the package is installed it can be called using command:<br /> 
greengraph<br />
This will run the default settings of New York to Chicago with 20<br /> 
and will output a graph but will not save it. It can also be called<br /> 
with arguments:<br />
-h<br />        
--from "start"<br />
--to "end"<br />
--steps "steps"<br />
--out "your file name"<br />
An example call of this is:<br />
greengraph --from London --to Oxford --steps 10 --out graph.png<br />
This will, as well as displaying the graph, save it as graph.png to your<br />
local directory.<br />
Calling with -h will display the on screen help
